# Fridge-Item-Tracker

# FORGET ME NOT by Repo Depot

## Project Idea and descriptions

This project is to help remind forgetful folks when their perishables are expiring and send helpful notifications (in the form of emails) prior to the date of expiration and/or prior to garbage day. We hope everyone can now have a better budgeted life after being influenced by our app!
